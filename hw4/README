compile from command line with:

javac Homework4.java -cp libs/commons-codec-1.10.jar

then run it with command:

java Homework4

I have uploaded a RSA.java file that found on the website, http://www.coders-hub.com/2013/04/implementation-of-rsa-using-java.html#.Vvhf7eIrLX4,
it can work, I think we better reference it or do something else.
